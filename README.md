# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Obert Guo
I enjoy solving a wide range of problems, anything from low level programming and embedded hardware, to creating high-level Web APIs, or computer graphics, algorithm efficiency and optimization, and all things Mathematics!

As hobbies, I love to play the piano and play badminton.
