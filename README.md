# Hello!
I am Obert Guo, and I enjoy solving a wide range of problems, anything from low level programming and embedded hardware, to creating high-level Web APIs, to computer graphics, to algorithm efficiency and optimization, and all things Mathematics!

As hobbies, I am great at playing the piano and badminton.
